## Key Features Explained

### Smart Content Extraction
The extension intelligently identifies main content areas using selectors like `article`, `main`, `.content`, etc., and falls back to body content if needed.

### Content Filtering
Automatically removes:
- Advertisements and sponsored content
- Navigation menus and sidebars
- Comments sections
- Social sharing buttons
- Cookie notices and popups

### Context-Aware Questions
Pre-defined questions adapt based on the website:
- **YouTube**: "Summarize this video", "What are the key points?"
- **Wikipedia**: "Summarize this article", "What are the main facts?"
- **E-commerce**: "What is this product?", "What are the features?"
- **GitHub**: "What does this code do?", "Explain the project"

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `storage`: To save your API key and settings
- `activeTab`: To access content from the current tab

## Privacy & Security
